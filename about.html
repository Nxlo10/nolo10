<p> Hi My name is Akinola Akinbolu and I am an IT major here at Kennesaw State Univesity with a concentration in cyber security. I also love to play soccer and have dreams of going to play in the professional level. I love to work out and build my self mentally and physically. I graduated from Archer High School in 2021. I decided to major in IT because I have strong passion for tech and find it very interesting. Even though I am a junior here,its actually my 2nd year here because when I was a freshman I did online schooling and found it well. I also enjoy playing video games, so its wise that you know that I am very competittive  On part-time I work at Home depot.</p>
